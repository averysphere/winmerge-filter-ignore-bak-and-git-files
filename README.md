# winmerge-filter-ignore-bak-and-git-files
A WinMerge filter that ignores or hides most backup files usually created automatically by editors.

For now this filter ignores .bak and .BAK files, files starting with '~' or the tilde, as well as ignore Git's .ignore and .git folder. I included the Git folder because when I folder compare in WinMerge, this is also shown as changed when you have just commited or staged a working directory. Feel free to  edit the filter and add additional backup extensions used by many editors.
