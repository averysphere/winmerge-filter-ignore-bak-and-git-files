# Ignore Backup Files (.bak, .BAK) and VCS folders (.git / .svn)
### A WinMerge filter

A WinMerge filter that ignores or hides most backup files usually created automatically by editors.

For now this filter ignores or hides backup files that end with .bak and .BAK files, files starting with '~' or the tilde, as well as ignore Git's .ignore and .git folder and SVN's .svn folders. Feel free to  edit the filter and add additional backup extensions used by many editors.
